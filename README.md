## Getting Started

This app is designed for local use via `rails server`. The included API keys are allow-listed only for 127.0.0.1, so the app should be accessed at 127.0.0.1:3000 (or whichever port is provided to the server command).

This app intentionally will not work without a Rails master key. Please reach out to me for access.

## Testing

Tests can be run via `bundle exec rspec ./spec`.
